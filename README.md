# OOP_MLR

It is efficient to put machine learning models and other data science techniques into classes so that we can reuse them later and change attributes without changing the code behind these models. Independent concepts can also be put into independent classes: for example, the functioning of a cross-validate class should not affect the functioning of a linear regression class. These concepts are also referred to as high cohesion and loose coupling.
